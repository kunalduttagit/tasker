# Tasker
Amongst many small projects that I created during my junior year. This is my first react js application. A simple ToDo List application that allows you to create tasks, add time and date, and also allows you to highlight the most important tasks. You also hold the ability to delete tasks once done.

To run this app on your Local Machine
1. Git clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalduttagit/tasker.git
```

2. Move into the directory where you cloned this repository
```bash
cd tasker
```

3. Install all the dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

4. Open two terminals
- Run the React app
```bash
npm run start
```
- Run the local JSON server
```bash
npm run server
```

This should be enough to run a functional react app with. If you encouter any problems, contact me mailto:kunalduttaedu@gmail.com
